# COPD-Image-Analysis
This is a computer vision project focused on quantitative analysis of Emphysema and Small Airway Disease in Lung CTs

This repository does not contain the source code for the project yet but only the reports generated by the algorithms.

Team Members:

Brief explanation of the aim of the project:

  Emphysema and Small Airway Diseases are diagnosed and tracked with the help of computed tomography of lung. However, lung CT does not 
provide any quantitative, measurable, repeatable and reliably information about the phase and improvement of the patient's condition. 
This project is about developing an algorithm that can compare a patient's lung CT during expirium and inspirium phases and generate
a report that visiually and quantitatively shows which part of the patient's lung is normal or suffers from emphysema or small airway
disease. 

This project is being developed based on data provided by Suat Seren Research and Training Hospital and Ege Univerisity Medical Faculty 
Hospital.
